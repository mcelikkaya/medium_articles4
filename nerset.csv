"Report: Adam Neumann, Benchmark Unloaded $676.5M In WeWork Shares Before Failed IPO. The more we learn about the WeWork debacle, the more head-scratching it gets. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily According to a news report from The Telegraph, WeWork co-founder and ousted CEO Adam Neumann unloaded $361 million worth of shares when Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank first invested in the company in 2017. And he wasn’t the only one. The Telegraph reports that Benchmark , which was WeWorks’ first major investor, also cashed out at the time. It apparently “sold $315.5m in shares during the 2017 deal and a later SoftBank investment in 2019,” the news article reveals. Specifically, according to Crunchbase, Benchmark led WeWork’s $17 million Series A (ironically some may say) on April 1, 2012. This means that WeWork’s largest shareholders’ (previously undisclosed) sell-offs made up nearly one-third of the $2.3 billion worth of shares SoftBank bought from insiders right before the company was set to go public in 2019. The practice of early investors getting rid of their shares before an IPO is not an illegal one but, as The Telegraph and others on Twitter acknowledge, it’s not exactly typical. I mean, don’t most people hope a company goes public at a higher valuation so that they will make even more money? As The Wall Street Journal reporter Eliot Brown points out , a few other high-profile companies (Zynga, Groupon and Blue Apron) also saw their founders/CEOs sell a larger number of shares. In each of those cases, he said, the companies’ IPO prices were lower. For those of you who haven’t been following the WeWork saga, the company decided to cancel its IPO last September. At that point, SoftBank agreed to a $9.5 billion bailout of the company in a deal that included buying $3 billion worth of shares from existing investors at a $10 billion valuation. This was significantly less than the $47 billion valuation at which SoftBank purchased shares in 2019, noted The Telegraph. Earlier this month, our own Sophia Kunthara reported that SoftBank had withdrawn its $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares, citing conditions of the offer not being satisfied. Also today, SoftBank Group forecast a net loss of $7 billion for the fiscal year ended March due to the negative impact of coronavirus and losses related to WeWork, AFP reported .

"Report: Palantir Could Go Public In The Next Year. Big data analytics company Palantir Technologies may go public within the next year, CEO Alex Karp said on “ Axios on HBO .” Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily If the company goes public soon, it would be a big move for the IPO market, which has been slow so far this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Very few tech companies have gone public since the pandemic took hold, with most public debuts being pharmaceutical or health-centered companies. “The real holdup at Palantir was we were building products and we needed to kind of get enough of them out so that people would see the robustness of our company, both internally and externally,” Karp said on the show. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Palantir expected to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, breaking even for the first time in company history. The company, which was founded in 2004, has more than $2 billion in total funding, according to Crunchbase data . Backers include Manhattan Venture Partners and Bracket Capital . The company’s revenue was $739 million in 2019, up 24 percent from the previous year, according to Bloomberg. Karp noted in 2016 that he was considering an IPO for the company, although there was no timeline. For more details on Palantir’s financials, check out the Crunchbase News article here . The company’s been in something of an “IPO limbo” for some time, something Crunchbase News has noted before . So Karp saying that it could go public within the next year, when there’s a global pandemic, is interesting. Palantir, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel, is known for being extremely private and for having several contracts with the United States government. Most notably, the company took heat for contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, something, Karp said on Axios , that caused some of his favorite employees to leave.

"Portal Raises $2.55 Million, Launches Video Sharing App. In Asia, micro and in-app payments have become an important feature in many social content platforms, including WeChat. The tipping function on Tencent’s superapp has given more agency to the individuals consuming mobile content and is widely popular among WeChat users, creating a culture of monetary appreciation for creators. Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter One startup, Portal , is looking to bring the user-centric micro tipping phenomenon to the United States. CEO and Cofounder Jonathan Swerdlin told Crunchbase News that the mobile tipping phenomenon in Asia inspired Portal. “[Payments] are now just as easy in the West as they are [in Asia]. It’s just that a lot of companies have become so addicted to the ad model that they are not exploring these other models,” Swerdlin expressed. To that end, Swerdlin and his team have created a mobile video app that functions as a peer-to-peer payment-enabled content platform. The company, which is launching out of beta today, has raised an additional $2.55 million in seed funding, bringing its total funds raised to $4.2 million. The company’s investors include Mark Cuban , Day One Ventures , the founder of Thinx Miki Agrawa l, and others. With the Portal iOS app, creators can upload content, which shows up in a chronological feed. They can monetize their videos through paywalls on specific content and through the tipping model that allows users to instantly give anywhere from 10 cents to $100 with purchased coins. Soon, Portal will be launching an option for subscriptions ranging from 99 cents to $24.99 a month. In eliminating the ad model, Swerdlin and his team hope to give content creators an open opportunity to create with the support of their followers rather than relying on advertisers that the creators may not support, or that may not support their content. Portal is similar to other monetization platforms like Patreon , which was founded in 2013. Investors have funneled $105.9 million into the creator-focused startup, and it was last valued at just under $450 million. However, Swerdlin said that while Patreon focuses on crowdfunding, Portal is moving that idea a step further. “Patreon has done an amazing job. And what they’ve done is they’ve proven that audiences will absolutely unequivocally pay content creators. What we’re doing is we’re taking those tools for those payments, and we’re baking that directly into the experience, rather than making it a crowdfunding tool that you have to go outside to use,” he told Crunchbase News. He also noted that Twitch has implemented tipping and subscriptions for gaming, but that Portal is bringing that model to uploaded content for a more mainstream western audience. Portal’s beta users have included well-known content creators like The Young Turks and transgender activist Corey Rae. Crunchbase News asked Swerdlin how he believed the earnings potential would change as less popular users come onto the platform. “The earning potential is limitless. And the ability to earn is important for everyone. It’s going to depend on the not necessarily a size of your audience, but that the value and depth that you’re bringing to your audience,” Swerdlin said. In sticking with the ad-free model, Swerdlin says that he expects Portal to grow organically, with the team relying on word of mouth for its future growth. Without a huge amount of traction, battling a tech behemoth that is both deep-pocketed and culturally ubiquitous will undoubtedly prove to be a challenge. “Our focus is on making sure that this is a product that solves content creators’ and publishers’ biggest problems and gives people a platform that they can trust, where they’re getting the very best content that’s made. If we do that correctly, then word of mouth will be our greatest marketing engine.” Illustration Credit: Li Anne Dias","{'Day One Ventures': 'dayoneventures.com', 'Patreon': 'patreon.com', 'Thinx': 'shethinx.com', 'Portal': 'portal.xyz', 'Tencent': 'tencent.com', 'Twitch': 'twitch.tv'}"

"Peloton Confidentially Files for IPO. Peloton , the maker of pricey in-home bicycles and treadmills paired with on-demand fitness classes, announced today that it has filed to go public confidentially.

"Lunar Tech Startup ispace Raises $28M. Japanese space tech startup ispace has raised $28 million for its Series B round, bringing its total funding to about $125 million. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily The lunar exploration startup is working to build a commercial lunar lander. The company is aiming to be a “ gateway for the private sector to bring their business to the moon,” per a statement from the company. The Series B round was led by IF SPV 1st Investment Partnership (which is managed by Incubate Fund ), and included participation from Space Frontier Fund, Takasago Thermal Engineering Co. , and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. According to the announcement from the startup, the new funding will be used to develop its commercial lunar landing for ispace’s first mission, which is planned for 2022, as well as its second mission, which is planned for 2023. The company is also rolling out Blueprint Moon, a lunar business data platform meant to help others with lunar market entry by collecting and providing lunar data, per a statement from the company. “This new investment and launch of our new lunar data offering concept will not only support the steady development of ispace’s business, but will also prove that ispace can lead globally in the development of the lunar economy, expanding humanity’s presence into space and creating a more sustainable world,” CEO Takeshi Hakamada said in a statement.

"Giving Cats Some Love: Pet Food Startup Smalls Nabs $9M Series A For Cat Food. Smalls , the direct-to-consumer pet food company for cats, received a cash infusion of $9 million in Series A funding to expand its product offerings. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Left Lane Capital led the round, with participation from existing investors Founder Collective and Companion Fund . The new investment gives New York-based Smalls a total raise of $12 million since its inception in 2017. That includes a small seed round in 2018 and a seed extension in 2019, Matt Michaelson told Crunchbase News. Michaelson and Calvin Bohn started Smalls as a cat-first brand focusing on human-grade, fresh food. In the U.S. pet owners have 94 million cats versus approximately 89 million dogs. Further, about 95 percent of venture capital funding in the pet food industry goes to dog-centric companies, Michaelson said. Those statistics attracted Left Lane Partner Jason Fiedler , one of the first investors in The Farmer’s Dog . “While we’ve seen a proliferation of highly successful healthy dog food brands, the cat food market has remained completely ignored,” Fiedler said in a written statement. “Smalls has successfully developed a brand, product mix, supply chain, and customer experience that is specifically optimized for cats that no one else has.” The new funding will enable Smalls to grow its business, particularly around expanding food selection, such as formula innovation and new recipes for cats, which are naturally picky eaters, Michaelson said. It will also be used to help bring in new customers and subscribers. Next up, Smalls will continue acquiring new customers and making new hires. The company currently has an employee base of 18, and Michaelson expects that number to grow to 25 by next year. Year over year, the company has experienced four times revenue growth and has several thousand subscribers. Its growth is credited in part to the overall online cat food delivery market experiencing a 162 percent year-over-year increase from March 2019 to March 2020, Michaelson said. “Our growth has been pushed a bit by COVID-19,” he added. “On one level, more people are looking for food that shows up at their door. On another, pet adoption is exploding, and as people spend more time with cats, they are thinking about their health and wellness.” Photo courtesy of Smalls Illustration: Li-Anne Dias","{'Companion Fund': 'companionfund.com', 'Smalls': 'smalls.com', 'Founder Collective': 'foundercollective.com', 'The Farmer’s Dog': 'thefarmersdog.com', 'Left Lane Capital': 'leftlanecap.com'}"
"Relish Secures $5M Series A To Grow Relationship Training App. Gaining a more fulfilling relationship with a significant other is an ongoing activity, made even more important today as many couples spend either a lot of time together, or not as much, because of social distancing. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Serial entrepreneur Lesley Eccles has raised a $5 million Series A round of funding to fuel growth plans for Relish , her new customized relationship training app that makes it easy to build a happy, healthy, more connected relationship with your partner. “It doesn’t matter how much money or success you have, what matters are the relationships in your life: How strong are they, and how happy are you?” Eccles told Crunchbase News. The app uses machine learning to create a customized, scientifically backed relationship improvement plan in the form of interactive lessons, quizzes and activities, with qualified human relationship coaches on hand for support when needed, she said. The 1-year-old company’s Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from previous investors Trinity Ventures and Bullpen Capital . This latest round brings the company’s total funding to $7.2 million, which includes a $2.2 million venture round in October 2018, according to Crunchbase data. In addition to the raise, Rob Stavis, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, will join Relish’s board of directors. The concept for Relish started at the end of 2017, when Eccles left fantasy sports platform FanDuel where she was a co-founder. She began reading books about relationship science and psychology, and started digging deeper into what makes a strong relationship between intimate partners. “The idea behind Relish is to get people thinking about relationship wellness,” she said. “I want to make the world a happier place. Two years ago, that was relevant to me, but today it is relevant to the world at large.” The app mimics the experience of seeing a relationship coach, proposing customized lessons and activities based on an assessment, and will adapt as the lessons and activities are completed, Eccles said. There is also a team of relationship coaches who users can reach out to for advice. Eccles said the app is growing by 30 percent to 40 percent each month. Meanwhile, Relish is free to download, and the annual subscription is $99 for two people. Similar apps, she said, can cost near that per week. Prior to today’s environment of social distancing, Relish users downloaded the app because they felt disconnected from their partner and wanted to improve communication skills, Eccles said. Now, she sees users who are at home together and find they have more time to reflect on their relationship and invest in it–if it is not too late. “There is also this idea that you are in a pressure-cooker environment, and cracks in the relationship are now chasms,” she added. “You need help, but can’t go and meet friends. Relish is helpful for those types of relationships as well.” Illustration: Li-Anne Dias .","{'Bessemer Venture Partners': 'bvp.com', 'FanDuel': 'fanduel.com', 'Trinity Ventures': 'trinityventures.com', 'Bullpen Capital': 'bullpencap.com', 'Relish': 'hellorelish.com'}"
"Postmates Raises $300M, Targets 2019 IPO. Postmates , an American delivery startup, announced today that it closed $300 million in a new funding round. Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter Tiger Global led the round. The investor is a prior investor in Postmates, having previously taken part in its massive Series D. Postmates had raised $278 million before this round, meaning that its latest capital infusion is greater in scale than all of its preceding raises combined. According to Fortune , the new round values Postmates at “approximately $1.2 billion.” That valuation comes against what Recode reporter Jason Delrey describes as “an operating loss of $75 million on $250 million in revenue in 2017” at the startup. Postmates itself released a grip of metrics as part of its funding announcement, including notes on scale (greater than $1 billion annual gross merchandise volume), financial health (gross margins now “nearly 50 [percent] in the last year”), market viability (90 percent of locales “driving profitability,” which likely means positive contribution margin), and promises (more markets and 75 percent of US household penetration coming this “Fall”). Those numbers and factoids along with the new capital point Postmates in a single direction, per its CEO’s comments and the company’s blog post: an IPO. Per the company: “We’ll balance targeted growth strategies, smart unit economics, and sensible customer pricing to expand from urban cores to suburban and rural parts of the country. And we’ll march towards an IPO.” That Postmates wants to go public isn’t historically surprising; an IPO is a standard way for young companies to show maturity and provide liquidity to investors and employees. But to be so upfront about it in the unicorn era is notable. Uber is also targeting an IPO , while fellow unicorns Airbnb and Pinterest seem less certain . Uber has 2019 in mind for its own debut. As does Postmates. Postmates’s CEO noted in an interview that “[w]e have a beautiful path to an IPO in 2019.” Questions remain and competition abounds, but Postmates remains far more than not-dead in a market that many presumed Uber would simply take over. Not so, so far. More on the matter when Postmates inevitably begins releasing financial information directly, or via targeted leaks, as it gets a few quarters out from filing.

"In Growing Cybersecurity Market, Darktrace Raises $50M Series E. Cybersecurity platform Darktrace has raised $50 million in Series E funding. The round was led by Vitruvian Partners . Previous investors KKR and TenEleven Ventures also participated. Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter The company has raised $229.5 million in total known funding. That includes the company’s $75 million Series D in July 2011. (Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan told Crunchbase News in an email that $25 million of that round was secondary market financing.) The company is now valued at $1.65 billion, post-money. Founded in 2013, Darktrace deploys an AI-powered cybersecurity software that assesses normal behavior, detects abnormalities, and automatically responds to threats. The company has also launched an autonomous response platform for cloud systems and an email threat mitigation platform. “Darktrace is a self-contained system that is deployed in less than an hour, requiring zero human configuration or training,” Eagan told Crunchbase News in an email. “Once deployed, it instantly begins learning ‘normal’ for the network, and is identifying genuine threats and anomalies in just seven days.” The company is based in Cambridge, UK but has offices globally. The company currently “operates within 7,000 unique networks,” and its customers range in industry from retail to government. Eagan told Crunchbase News the company is also working with local and state governments in the U.S., including the City of Las Vegas and Livingston County. The company isn’t releasing specific revenue metrics, but Eagan wrote that Darktrace has grown by 100% over the past year, and that its company-wide contract agreements totaled $400 million. With the funding, the company plans to increase its 750 global headcount to 1,000 by the end of the year. It also plans to open more global offices in “regions where demand is highest.” Cybersecurity has been a hot topic among governments and in the venture world recently. Other companies are leveraging AI for cybersecurity including Cylance and Crowdstrike (valued at $3 billion) which raised $120 million and $200 million , respectively, in June 2018.

"Quidnet Energy’s $10M Series B Paves Way For Commercial Expansion. Quidnet Energy announced on Tuesday that it closed on a $10 million Series B round of financing and a contract with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for commercial demonstration of its Geomechanical Pumped Storage (GPS) technology. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Based in Houston, Quidnet has offices in San Francisco and Saratoga Springs, New York. Its technology is a form of hydroelectric energy storage using time-tested well-drilling and construction technologies to pump water under pressure into subsurface geological reservoirs to store energy, the company said in a written statement. When variable renewable energy is not available, this water is released to drive hydroelectric turbines to power the electric grid. Existing investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Evok Innovations participated in the round, as well as new investors Trafigura and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust , the company said in the statement. The new funding brings Quidnet’s total raise to $18 million since its inception in 2013, which includes an $8 million venture round in 2018, according to Crunchbase data. Quidnet said the new round of funding will help it work with electric utilities and deliver commercial-scale projects across the North American electric grid. The company also plans to expand its team and infrastructure. The investment will also fund the construction of near-term projects, including a 2-megawatt project implementing GPS as part of the company’s new contract with NYSERDA. Both the funding and new contract represent the start of deployment of commercial-scale facilities across priority markets, Quidnet Energy CEO Joe Zhou said in a written statement. “Integrating renewables and replacing retiring thermal generation require cost-effective long-duration electricity storage at an immense scale. While traditional pumped hydro has provided over 95 percent of the world’s grid-scale storage, that approach faces significant siting and cost limitations going forward,” he said. “Quidnet unlocks these constraints to fundamentally change the economics and deployment profile of long-duration storage.” Illustration: Li-Anne Dias","{'Quidnet': 'quidnetenergy.com', 'Trafigura': 'trafigura.com', 'Breakthrough Energy Ventures': 'breakthroughenergy.org', 'Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust': 'granthamtrust.org', 'Quidnet Energy': 'quidnetenergy.com', 'Evok Innovations': 'evokinnovations.com'}"

"Getting Their Gobble On: Food Delivery Funding In 2019 . Food delivery is an interesting category. It’s not a new concept, but tech has enabled it to be done more efficiently on the consumer end. Lots of startups have popped up in the space in recent years, they’ve become popular among consumers, and many companies have grown extremely fast. Crunchbase News has written plenty about food delivery companies before, including about how one even managed to make an adjusted profit . But as the year ends, we wanted to take a look at how much venture capital love (i.e. funding) the space had received so far this year. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily A couple of caveats about the data: the numbers focus on venture capital and exclude non-venture funding (private equity, venture debt, grants, etc.) and include companies tagged with “food delivery” in Crunchbase’s data set. It’s possible there’s a lag in reporting funding, so the data may not be perfect, but it’s a pretty good guiding metric. Lastly, Q4 of 2019 isn’t over yet, so it’s possible that food delivery companies could receive a flood of cash in the next month or so and significantly change the funding totals for this quarter and this year. So far in Q4 this year, food delivery companies have received nearly $387 million in total venture capital funding. That’s significantly less than during the same period last year. Between Oct. 1, 2018 and Nov. 26, 2018, food delivery companies brought in almost $6.2 billion in VC dollars. For all of Q4 2018, food delivery companies received close to $7.3 billion in funding. That’s pretty different from the situation this year. In 2019 so far, food delivery companies have received around $3.8 billion in funding, which is less than how much companies in the space received in just Q4 of last year. Last year, food delivery companies received around $11 billion in funding over the course of the whole year (it was about $10 billion by Nov.26, 2018), while so far this year, it’s about $3.8 billion. Colombia’s Rappi had the largest venture capital funding round of food delivery companies in 2019, with the startup bringing in $1 billion in its Series E round. This year has also seen DoorDash pull in huge chunks of cash, with the company raising $1 billion in venture capital this year through its $400 million Series F in February and its $600 million Series G in May. Food delivery hasn’t been without its fair share of problems and speculation this year: DoorDash came under fire for its tipping practices and we’re still waiting on Postmates to go public. So while the funding totals for this year lag behind last year, high-profile companies are still pulling in serious cash.

"Steady Raises $15M Series B. The COVID-19 pandemic closed down restaurants, stores, event venues and countless other businesses, costing millions of people their jobs. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily With 1.5 million people filing for first-time unemployment benefits for the week ending June 6, finding a job is no easy task. That’s why Atlanta-based startup Steady wants to help–and it raised $15 million in a Series B round to do so. The premise of Steady is to help low-to-moderate-income workers figure out how they can make more money. The company acquired data and analyzed it to determine how people earn money and tie that information back to their skills, experience and geography to help fill in income gaps and better spend their time. For example, if a person is earning $11 per hour working at a store, Steady will point out if a store across the street is hiring for a role that requires similar tasks, but pays more. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, the company basically had to take a step back and reassess. “Right now, people just don’t have money, period,” CEO Adam Roseman said, pointing out that although many people who lost their jobs receive unemployment benefits, the CARES Act is set to expire at the end of July. Now, the company’s goal is to give people a “fighting chance” to find work by directing them to opportunities where they have the highest likelihood of getting hired. That means weeding out postings for jobs at companies that have frozen hiring, for example. Steady, along with investor Shaquille O’Neal , introduced the Steady Together Initiative, which distributed $2 million in emergency cash grants for members who lost their income. A lot of the new funding will be invested in the company’s data architecture, and the rest will be used to address other challenges associated with not having a job (think things like telemedicine support without a subscription fee). “I think [our] No. 1 (goal) is worker impact,” Roseman said. “The lives of the working-class American population are just getting smashed.” Since Steady is a for-profit company, its secondary goal is aligning its revenue stream with user impact, he said. The company makes money through partnerships in its personalized marketplace for financial services and benefits. Steady partners with companies that provide services like no-fee digital checking accounts. If, for example, Steady sees in a member’s bank account that they are paying a lot of overdraft fees, it will refer the member to a no-fee digital checking account and split the referral fee with the member. Steady has products for reducing costs like care insurance and student loan payments, and will be announcing a consumer-facing revenue stream in the near future, Roseman said. The company sees itself as something like a 21st century version of a union, Roseman said. When it goes out to negotiate benefits and partnerships, there’s strength in the fact that the Steady community has 2 million members. In terms of growth, Steady has doubled its user base over the last nine months, reaching the 2 million member mark. Its first quarter revenue for 2020 has already surpassed revenue for all of 2019, and it’s continuing to accelerate, Roseman said. Recruit Strategic Partners led the Series B round, with participation from investors including Flourish Ventures and Propel Venture Partners . Steady raised its $9 million Series A in August 2018.

"How Legal Weed Disrupted This Flower Startup’s Supply Chain. Christina Stembel clearly remembers the day after California legalized recreational marijuana. That day in November 2016 was a tipping point for one of the biggest pivots her then-six-year-old startup, Farmgirl Flowers, had made to date. “The day after the vote went through and it was a ‘yes’ in California, our largest calla lily grower in California took out all of their calla lilies to put in cannabis instead … to get the soil ready for it,” Stembel said during an interview for Yahoo Finance’s Breakouts series. “It was pretty immediate,” she said. “And we had to change our entire supply chain in four months, otherwise we wouldn’t have had enough flowers for Valentine’s Day after the vote.” Stembel, 42, is founder and CEO of Farmgirl Flowers, a San Francisco-based e-commerce flower bouquet delivery company that brought in $30 million in sales last year. Selling an assortment of burlap-wrapped anemones, poppies and calla lilies, Stembel and her team of more than 160 employees have aimed to disrupt a multi-billion floriculture industry rooted in more old-fashioned, cellophane-wrapped arrangements of blood-red roses and baby’s breath. But Stembel’s business itself was disrupted by recreational cannabis legalization in her company’s home state. After the legalization vote, many of the local suppliers she’d once leaned on to provide the flowers that made up her bouquets were suddenly turning to a new crop. “There’re only so many farms out there in the United States now,” said Stembel. “And if they can make $2 a square foot or $1.50 a square foot on cannabis, versus $0.05 or $0.10 on snap dragons, it’s a very easy choice for them.” “I don’t blame them for that,” she added. “They’re business people as well. But there’s definitely a lot of the flower farmers [that] have switched to growing a lot more cannabis and less flowers for that reason alone.” The U.S. cannabis industry is poised to become a near $30 billion industry by 2025, according to New Frontier Data . That would begin to close in on the U.S. floriculture industry, which saw just under $35 billion in sales in 2019 , according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. And unlike the cannabis industry, which is expected to see sales rise at a compounded annual growth rate of 14% through 2025, floriculture sales have stagnated in the low-$30 million range for years. Farmgirl Flowers has been far from the only player in the cut flower industry to take a hit from burgeoning legal recreational cannabis market. A number of reports have highlighted former Californian flower growers who switched to cannabis, as rising competition from cheaper flowers coming from Latin America drove down prices they could command from their existing flower crops. And incidentally, Latin America was ultimately where Stembel turned when her former suppliers in the U.S. had shriveled on the vine. After nearly seven years of sourcing from local farmers, Stembel wrote an open letter to her customers explaining her decision, and began buying from farmers in South America. The decision was driven both by the disruption from cannabis legalization, and by a broader inability to find enough U.S.-based farms willing to sell to her start-up to keep pace with customer orders. “We just ran out of supply,” Stembel said. “There was not a supply for our demand, and so I needed to do something different. Or I needed to either stop doing business or stay a very small business and not scale.” To date, the shift in sourcing has so far worked for Farmgirl Flowers, with the company consistently delivering between 6,000 and 8,000 bouquets per week across 48 states. For the week of Valentine’s Day 2019, Stembel anticipates that number will jump more than 50% over last year to 30,000. Eventually, Stembel said the pendulum may swing back in the other direction and that farmers may begin shifting back to growing flowers, once the cannabis industry matures and the cultivation market becomes saturated. “If everybody is growing cannabis, there’s going to be a point, which we probably have already met, where we just have oversupply,” she said. “Maybe it’ll shift back a little bit, but in the meantime, we’re going to have to find other options.” — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

"Legal Tech Platform Bodhala Brings In $10M To Help Clients Streamline Spending. Law firms are not always the quickest at adopting new technology, but two Harvard Law School grads are hoping to change that. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Raj Goyle and Ketan Jhaveri started New York City-based Bodhala , a data-intelligence and legal technology platform, to disrupt how law firms charge for outside services. Companies spend about $500 billion annually on outside counsel, while hourly billing rates track at nearly four times the rate of inflation, Goyle said. Bodhala applies data science, machine learning and analytic insights to help companies analyze, interpret and optimize outside counsel spend. “Right now, even the most sophisticated company doesn’t have an idea of what something should cost,” Goyle said. “We have built algorithms that when a law firm puts invoices through the software, it gives them insight and analytics on things such as why so many lawyers are working on a case, why they chose an expensive law firm or why they paid that hourly billing. Our database helps companies understand what is wrong with what they are spending and how to correct it.” To help achieve that goal, the 5-year-old company closed on a $10 million investment round on Wednesday, led by Edison Partners , a growth equity investment firm which most recently led a $17.5 million round of funding for Austin-based Overhaul, a supply chain tech startup. “Bodhala is a quite disruptive technology around analyzing spend and offering suggestions,” said Daniel Herscovici, partner at Edison Partners. “As more and more buyers adopt this technology, the more influential it will be. The company has the potential to become the standard for transparency, codifying and transforming the legal industry.” With this round of funding, Bodhala has raised a total of $15 million, according to Goyle. The company will use the funds for product expansion, and sales and market acceleration, as it transforms and modernizes the purchase of outside counsel services. Bodhala has 35 employees, and Goyle said the company intends on “doubling down on the business” to grow every aspect from business development to data, and marketing over the next two years. The company currently has several dozen clients, as well as potential new clients in financial services, health care services, insurance, energy and private equity. Revenue jumped 300 percent over 2019, and Goyle expects that kind of growth to stick around in the near term.

"Pricey Hardware And Subscription Revenue Drive Millions Into Connected Exercise Equipment Startups. It’s the holiday season, which for you likely means lots of travel, shopping, and, of course, food. Lots and lots of calorically dense food. Barring a lot of self-discipline, most of us will start 2020 a little softer around the edges. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily New year, new you, right? A lot of us will end up hitting the gym, but if you have the space and cash to swing it, there are an increasing number of home fitness options to consider. Now, to be clear, the idea of buying a treadmill or stationary bike or rowing machine for home use is not new. What is new, however, are the slew of internet-connected fitness equipment offerings with classes and progress tracking on a subscription basis, allowing companies to capture value not just from the sale of physical hardware (a typically low-margin business) and long-term revenue on high-margin services over time. This business model is compelling to some venture capitalists, who’ve poured millions of dollars into the connected exercise equipment sector. In the chart below, we plot the total venture capital raised by companies in the connected fitness sector. Peloton is likely the best-known venture on the list. The connected stationary bike and treadmill company helped to create the business model described earlier. In Crunchbase News’s coverage of the company’s S-1 filing prior to its IPO, we showed how an ever-larger proportion of Peloton’s revenue is attributable to subscription revenue. Its stationary bike costs over $2,200, but to access the guided spin classes with energetic instructors, its customers pay an additional $39 per month for the privilege. Tonal is another. Its nearly $3,000 (plus tax and delivery) wall-mounted resistance training device has a $49 per month membership fee, which, like Peloton, grants Tonal users access to the company’s class catalog. A MIRROR , similarly, costs nearly $1,500 (plus a $250 installation fee) but requires a $39 monthly subscription to use. Otherwise it’s just a wall-mounted mirror. Clearly, these devices are marketed to and priced for people with a fair amount of disposable income. The devices themselves are not inexpensive. The subscription fees may be nominal, relative to a gym membership and the extra hassle of commuting to a workout, but if people stop paying them, the devices either stop working, or they lose the tech-enabled “magic” that makes the equipment so appealing to a certain segment of the market. It’s a figurative treadmill involving, in some cases, a literal treadmill. The premise of hooking a fitness fanatic for life is an appealing one for sure, but it can be costly.

"Peloton’s Recovery Paints The Market Bullish. Morning Markets: Peloton is back above its IPO price after a trip to the doldrums. Perhaps the public market is already over its flight-to-quality and focus on profits. When Peloton filed to go public, the consumer-exercise phenom received wall-to-wall coverage. Given the company’s high marketing spend, its brand was well known even by non-users. So, the press couldn’t help itself. Crunchbase News included . Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Investors seemed similarly intrigued. After setting a $26 to $29 per-share IPO price range , Peloton, fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital , was set to roughly double its final private valuation . Eventually pricing at $29 per share , Peloton started life as a public company worth about $8.1 billion. But then things went off the rails. Peloton opened at $27 per share and closed its first day as a public company worth under $26 per share. The result looked like a sharp rebuke of the company’s newly-extended valuation. And as SmileDirectClub , Uber , Lyft , and others struggled as public companies Peloton was looped into the idea that investors were clamping down valuation — and, therefore, revenue multiples — for tech-ish companies not selling software. Software companies sport high margins, and a high percentage of their revenue often recurs. The market values that particular cocktail richly, especially in recent quarters . When Peloton’s shares were falling alongside those of many of its newly-public brethren, it appeared that the market was cutting the prices of tech- enabled companies, in contrast to how it valued tech companies themselves. 1 But then something odd happened: Peloton’s shares rallied. The company, which reported earnings on Nov. 5, has recently seen its shares price not only recover from declines but surge past its IPO price. Heading into trading today, Peloton is worth $30.25 per share, after surging over 11 percent yesterday. In snark-parlance, this is called a narrative violation. For Peloton shareholders, it’s a welcome result. But what does it mean for startups? In recent years, the startup mantra has been something like ‘growth at all costs.’ Investors liked high-growth companies, and have been more willing to overlook massive losses if a company reported quickly growing revenue. The idea has been that if high-growth, cash-burning companies are well-funded, they can grow quickly and eventually turn a profit, bringing in outsized returns for their investors. It’s only been recently (within the past few months) that disappointing IPOs have turned people’s attention toward unit economics and profitability . But maybe that was just a brief distraction, and growth is back en vogue. We’ll be able to tell by looking at how other high-growth, money-losing companies perform on the public markets to tell us if growth really is back in; in contrast, if other companies that fit the bill don’t see rising values, Peloton would be merely bucking a trend instead of showing that the trend itself is changing. The public markets haven’t been kind to unicorns like Uber and Lyft , but if their stock starts to rise, it could be an indication that investors have more faith in high-growth companies than has been the sentiment recently. A change in market sentiment could also have an impact on the IPO market. While 2019 has seen a crop of lackluster IPOs (the stock prices of companies being below the set price on its first day of trading and beyond), a shift in attitude back towards fast growth being more important than profits could allow for better public market reception of companies that still lose money. Time and market activity will tell.

"Hippo Insurance Acquires Sheltr. Home insurance startup Hippo bought home maintenance startup Sheltr , its first acquisition, the companies announced Thursday. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Hippo sells home insurance, using technology to find issues in homes before they become large, expensive problems. The idea has found wide backing, with the company raising $209 million in total funding to date, according to Crunchbase. To take a more proactive approach to home insurance, Hippo conducted a variety of pilot programs, including using Sheltr, to spot issues in homes before they became larger problems, according to Daniel Blanaru , the company’s VP of Growth Initiatives. “As we were doing that over the last couple of years, the Sheltr team really stood out not only in the quality of technology, as well as the operational sort of sophistication that they brought to their business, but more so it was their alignment with Hippo on customers, value of services,” Blanaru said in an interview with Crunchbase News. Sheltr helps homeowners with maintaining their properties by doing home checkups, writing up home “health summaries,” and connecting homeowners with professionals for maintenance services if there’s ever a breakdown, according to its website. Hippo wasn’t looking to make acquisitions, but after working with the Sheltr team, bringing them in-house was a “no brainer,” Blanaru said. Hippo isn’t disclosing how much it paid for Sheltr, which was founded earlier this year and has about $3.2 million in seed funding, according to Crunchbase. The company isn’t ruling out more acquisitions in the future, but they will be a rarity and only happen if it makes sense, Blanaru said. “We’ve been working (with Hippo) for much of Sheltr’s life, obviously we’re a really young company,” Sheltr CEO Andrew Wynn said. “But as we partnered with a lot of players in the space, it became really apparent that Hippo’s focus on customers and its proactive approach to insurance wasn’t skin deep.” Sheltr has eight employees, who will join Hippo’s approximately 200-person workforce. Hippo is trying to move away from the model where insurers only interact with customers when they pay a bill or submit a claim, Blanaru said. The company is trying to create more of a relationship with customers by taking a proactive approach to home insurance, rather than just react when something happens. For example, Hippo takes aerial images of homes to see if there is any discoloration or problems with a roof and sends customers “smart home kits” that will alert them to issues like water leaks. “For us it’s really leading the charge on a broader trend of insurance being the entry point to support and enable homeowners on a broader level,” Blanaru said.

"Brex Cuts Staff After Raising $150M. A little over a week after announcing $150 million in new funding, fintech startup Brex is laying off part of its staff. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily In a blog post published Friday, co-CEOs Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras wrote that 62 people would be let go. The company, best known for its corporate credit cards for startups, will be prioritizing building over growing this next year, according to the post. “Three months in, it’s clear that the impact of COVID-19 won’t be short-lived. We know that the pace of growth won’t be what we expected for the foreseeable future,” the CEOs wrote. “This unique situation created the space for us to think about the future of Brex, and how we could use this time to accelerate our mission — to reimagine financial systems so every growing company can realize their full potential.” The company will be taking another look at investments that don’t make sense, and some teams will be reduced, along with changed roles and some people being asked to switch teams. Brex is far from the first well-funded, buzzy startup to have layoffs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But the layoffs are a bit surprising, given that the company announced just last week it raised $150 million in funding in a round from investors including Lone Pine Capital and DST Global that valued the company at just over $3 billion. “I’m glad this round came together, but if it hadn’t, we would’ve been fine,” Dubugras recently told TechCrunch in an interview about the new round. “The capital is so we can play offensive while everyone else plays defensive.” In a statement announcing the new funding, Brex said it would be using the money to invest in engineering, product and design. It also planned to “use a combination of organic efforts as well as small acquisitions to supplement its hiring and product development efforts.” Illustration: Dom Guzman","{'DST Global': 'dst-global.com', 'Brex': 'brex.com', 'Lone Pine Capital': 'lonepinecapital.com'}"
"VC Satisfies Its Sweet Tooth By Giving Insomnia Cookies $3.93M In Capital. Insomnia Cookies , a mainstay on college campuses for late night warm, gooey cookie delivery, has raised $3.93 million in equity-based financing, according to a Form D filing. This is the company’s first known venture capital funding to date. Insomnia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily But here’s what we do know: In 2018, Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corp. acquired a majority stake in the cookie chain, which some reports valuing Insomnia at $500 million . Insomnia was allowed to work as an independent company. Insomnia was founded in a dorm room in 2003 by Seth Berkowitz, a student at the University of Pennsylvania. Three years later, it opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Syracuse, New York. Mix in some food trucks, an app, and a goodbye to food trucks, and Insomnia has since grown to over 155 locations. It caters to both individuals and companies. In 2019, it expanded to new locations, like Brooklyn and Austin. Beyond its gooey double chocolate chunk and limited edition red velvet cookies, Insomnia’s strength (and differentiation from a run of the mill bakery) comes from its late night delivery services. In fact, the company’s senior director of marketing, Megan Bruton, told CNBC that college campuses were “where the business started and with good reason.” The statement continued to say that late night delivery “is music to any college student’s ears after a long night of studying, or being out until the bars close.” In fact, my college campus has one too , and it made a regular appearance at our school newspaper meetings. We’ll have more when Berkowitz gets back to me, but one thing is for sure: some investors have found Insomnia’s growth from dorm room idea to hundreds of locations as a craving definitely worth cashing in on.

"Lululemon To Buy Mirror For $500M. Athleisure company Lululemon has agreed to buy connected fitness startup Mirror for $500 million, the companies announced this week. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily When the acquisition is completed, Mirror will operate as a standalone company within Lululemon, and Mirror CEO Brynn Putnam will continue working as the fitness startup’s chief executive, according to a statement from the company. Mirror, which is backed by investors including Spark Capital , Point72 Ventures and Lululemon, has live classes, on-demand workouts, and personal training options. The company, which launched in 2018, is based in New York. “In 2019, we detailed our vision to be the experiential brand that ignites a community of people living the sweatlife through sweat, grow and connect,” Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement. “The acquisition of MIRROR is an exciting opportunity to build upon that vision, enhance our digital and interactive capabilities, and deepen our roots in the sweatlife. We look forward to learning from and working with Brynn Putnam and the team at MIRROR to accelerate the growth of personalized in-home fitness.” Connected fitness has certainly become a popular sector for startup investments, as we’ve written about before . Additionally, there’s been an increase in demand for at-home fitness companies like Mirror and Peloton since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales for at-home fitness equipment has soared, and gyms have also started renting out their spin bikes and other equipment to bring in revenue while they’ve remained closed. And with many people staying home, it’s not a far stretch to say there’s also likely been more people in athleisure or comfort-wear, like what Lululemon offers. Mirror last raised money with its $34 million Series B in October 2019. Point72 Ventures led the round, and Lululemon participated as an investor.

"Data Shows Boston’s Historical Progress In Funding Women. On a Monday morning in her office on Newbury Street, Sarah Fay of Glasswing Ventures said that for venture capitalists to invest in more diverse founders, “we have to drop the idea that a CEO needs to be a braveheart on a white horse.” Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily “The personality of a woman is going to be different than a man, so you have to […] understand that someone can be effective, even if they really aren’t aggressive,” the managing director of the firm continued. “It’s about opening the door wider.” Fay is one of two female partners at Glasswing Ventures, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The firm focuses on artificial intelligence investments. Notably, about 40 percent of the founding teams of the companies Glasswing invests include at least one woman, according to Fay. Citing female-led venture capital funds like Glasswing, and venture capitalists like Fay, All Raise , a nonprofit organization that wants to help more female founders get venture capital, expanded into Boston last month. Fay is part of the steering committee. All Raise ’s expansion shows there’s both a need and a promise for more venture dollars to go to female founders in the city. So, for this month’s Boston-focused column, we thought we’d unpack the dollars raised by teams with at least one woman founder in Greater Boston over time. First, we’ll do the numbers, then we’ll circle back to Fay to see how it all fits into All Raise’s mission. Before we get into the numbers, some caveats. Venture rounds are often prey to reporting delays, and, sometimes, founders are not tagged in Crunchbase with gender identifying characteristics. For this reason, we opted for a proportional split chart to help account for any lag in known data. Housekeeping aside, $979 million dollars have gone to venture capital-backed companies with at least one female founder so far in 2019, according to Crunchbase data. Starkly, $1.8 billion dollars went to venture capital companies with all-male founding teams. To get a more helpful perspective on how (and if) more female founders are getting funded within Greater Boston, let’s wind back to 2014. The chart below breaks down the percentage break down of the data above. In 2016, 28 percent of venture capital dollars raised by Greater Boston startups went to companies with at least one female founder. Compared to years prior, 2019 isn’t at the same level of equality, but it is also isn’t exactly fair to hold it to the same standards due to possible data reporting delays. Fast forward to 2018, and 43 percent of venture capital dollars raised by Greater Boston startups went to companies with at least one female founder. It isn’t a 50/50 split; however, the percentage is notably high. Globally, about 8 percent of venture dollars have gone to female founders, according to the latest quarterly statistics . Its historical progress of venture capital dollars going to underrepresented founders—coupled with a stark contrast to global averages—is part of the reason Boston was put on All Raise’s radar in the first place. After all, where better place for a nonprofit to set up a pipeline and network of women in tech than a place that has already taken steps to level the playing field? Now, along with the Boston launch, the non-profit operates in the Bay Area, New York, and Los Angeles. All Raise has some lofty objectives it aims to achieve. Within the next five years , the organization wants 25 percent of all venture dollars allocated to female-founded companies. It also wants to double the percentage of female partners at venture firms (with funds greater than $25 million) in the United States from 9 percent to 18 percent over the next ten years. To do this, one of All Raise’s flagship efforts has been in creating a database of diverse candidates for venture capital firms to tap into. The organization also has cohorts, where women interested venture positions from associates to general partners can join a “tight-knit groups where deep connections trump empty schmoozing and real conversations replace small talk,” per the website . According to Glasswing’s Fay, in Boston, that looks like founder bootcamps, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Within these efforts, All Raise is intentionally having a conversation beyond just gender, when it comes to shifting pattern recognition in venture funding. “There are a lot of women involved with All Raise who are already successful,” she said. Fay also added that men, alongside women, need to be included in the conversation too. “If we’re just talking to each other as women to women, then we’re in an echo chamber,” she said. “So it is very important for men to also understand what the experiences are, so they can support us. And I can tell you in Boston, the [venture capitalists] who are men here are great.” Illustration: Li-Anne Dias","{'All Raise': 'allraise.org', 'Glasswing Ventures': 'glasswing.vc', 'Glasswing': 'glasswing.vc'}"
"Supergiant VC Rounds Weren’t Limited To Late-Stage Startups. It’s become the norm for some private tech companies to raise in a single round what VC firms raise for an entire new fund. For a certain class of large, rapidly-growing companies flying in the rarified air of startup finance, raising $100 million or more in a venture round is, if you’ll forgive the pun, just not that big of a deal anymore. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Supergiant venture capital rounds are on the rise across all stages, data from Crunchbase shows. It’s common to associate nine-figure VC deals with later-stage companies. The first nine-figure round Uber raised was its GV-led Series C, in which the company raised at least $258 million (though Crunchbase data states $363 million ) in 2013, after the company had been around for a little over four years, previously raising just under $50 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data. Facebook, founded near the beginning of the “unicorn era” (starting in January 2003, as stated in Aileen Lee’s article defining the term “unicorn startups”) 1 raised its first supergiant round in 2007, also three years after launch, and also at Series C. VC rounds of $100 million or more really took off in 2014 and 2015, as massive amounts of money began flowing into venture capital funds at the far end of the assets-under-management spectrum, which, in turn, began investing ever-larger sums in a subset of startups. While concentrated in late-stage deals, supergiant venture checks aren’t exclusive to more mature companies. Series A and Series B deals accounted for between 21 and 37 percent of global supergiant deal volume since 2010, according to Crunchbase News analysis. This is in keeping with prior research, which indicated that companies aren’t getting much older or younger by the time they raise their first supergiant round.

"Uber’s Eats Ad Push Explained. Morning Markets: As on-demand companies hunt profits, expect more of what we’re now seeing from Uber. According to a report in TechCrunch , publicly-traded ride-hailing company Uber is working to invest in building an ads business inside of Uber Eats , its food-delivery service. The move, TechCrunch notes, comes after Uber Eats allowed restaurants to offer discounts in exchange for better placement inside of the application itself. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily While an advertising business inside of Eats makes good sense for Uber, in our view, it is better understood from a profit perspective than from a growth orientation one. What’s more, the move underscores the fact that while Uber has scaled Eats quickly, the service’s losses have grown as well ( more from Uber’s Q3 earnings here ). If the ads experiment goes well for Uber, expect to see yet-private, on-demand companies also pursue similar monetization methods. From the consumer perspective, don’t expect on-demand services to become cheaper; expect them instead to look for new sources of topline to staunch losses. Let’s explore the Uber example. Uber Eats is a quickly-growing portion of the larger Uber business. In the last quarter, Uber Eats pulled in $3.7 billion in gross bookings, representing a 73 percent increase year-over-year. Its revenue grew 64 percent year-over-year to $645 million and its adjusted net revenue also grew 105 percent to $392 million. Across most metrics, Uber Eats was the second-fastest-growing segment of the company in percentage terms, coming in only behind Freight. That makes sense, as Freight is a less mature division at Uber and therefore one growing from a smaller revenue base. In the quarter, Uber Eats accounted for 22 percent of Uber’s total gross bookings, compared to the year-ago quarter when it made up 16.6 percent. In the third quarter, Uber Eats made up 11 percent of the company’s adjusted net revenue, compared to last year when it made up 7.2 percent of the adjusted net revenue. It’s clear that Uber Eats is important to Uber’s growth story, as it’s one of the fastest-growing segments in the company while competing in the hot market of food delivery. It makes sense that Uber would double-down on the service by helping make it more commercially viable. That being said, Uber Eats is deeply unprofitable. It lost $316 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. For reference, Rides brought in $631 million in positive adjusted EBITDA during the same period. Uber Eats is a key driver of growth for the company while also a source of more red ink than Uber can stomach. The good is therefore also bad for Uber, a firm that very much wants to be valued on growth and not, say, GAAP profits. It’s stuck, therefore, pursuing Eats for the sake of growth while also trying to reach for profitability. Enter ads, a business that can layer revenue into the Eats mix, lessening pressure on Uber to raise fees or dig deeper into the coffers of restaurants to help its must-work food delivery service become a viable long-term business. Uber has a lot of cash, yes, but it also needs to start generating more of the stuff in time. If it doesn’t, it was never a real company to begin with.

"Q32 Bio Comes Online With $46M Series A To Develop Immunity Therapeutics. Q32 Bio , a biotechnology company developing treatments for patients with severe autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, secured $46 million in Series A funding, led by Atlas Venture , to officially launch, the company announced Thursday. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily The Cambridge, Massachusetts, company was also seeded and incubated by Atlas Venture. Q32 Bio’s lead candidate, ADX-914, was developed to re-regulate and restore healthy immune regulation in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the company said in a written statement. “Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are driven by dysregulation of the immune response,” Q32 Bio CEO Michael Broxson said in the statement. Autoimmune diseases–lupus and multiple sclerosis for example–cause the immune system to begin attacking the body. A Phase 1 human clinical trial for ADX-914 is planned for late 2020, the company said. In addition to Atlas Venture, the new funding round included OrbiMed Advisors , Abingworth , Sanofi Ventures , University of Colorado and Children’s Hospital Colorado Center for Innovation . Q32 Bio is also working on a platform to provide tissue-targeted regulation, ADX-097, which will go into clinical trials in late 2021, the company said. Because some autoimmune and inflammatory diseases become hyperactivated, causing the immune system to attack and damage healthy tissue, Q32 Bio’s approach aims to block those pathogens responsible. “This gives us a running start in developing therapies that may improve and save lives,” Broxson said.

"US Startups Look To South Korea Amid Country’s COVID Success. South Korea is a country winning in the war against COVID-19 and U.S. startups are taking notice. As a result of its success, the country has attracted entrepreneurs from around the world who are eager to grow their businesses during the pandemic. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Although growth for South Korea is not new–two years ago we reported that South Korea was working to establish itself as a startup innovation hub –recent reports from both HSBC and OECD have reinforced that South Korea is among the countries best positioned to capitalize on economic recovery from COVID-19. For one economic indicator, we caught up with the K-Startup Grand Challenge , a three-month acceleration program for startups in South Korea. Organizers reported a 33 percent surge in the number of applications received for the fifth installment of its program that starts in September. Claire Chang , founding partner of Palo Alto-based venture capital firm igniteXL Ventures , is an adviser to the K-Startup Grand Challenge and an expert on the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Korea. “As COVID numbers surge in South and North America, South Korea’s numbers remain low, not to mention Korea’s economy has been able to stay open while many other countries’ business operations are shut down or drastically reduced during the pandemic,” Chang said via email. “If you have plans to target Asia, Korea is a great place to test the market and expand your business to other parts of Asia.” Some U.S. entrepreneurs kept their operations in South Korea after finishing the K-Startup program there last year–a wise decision as the pandemic shut down economic activity elsewhere. One of those startups is Los Angeles-based GIBLIB . The startup offers on-demand continuing education for physicians wanting to learn directly from experts at top hospitals. GIBLIB co-founder Jihye Shin is currently stationed in Gangnam, Seoul, along with much of the startup’s developer team. GIBLIB’s commercialization focus has primarily been in the U.S., but after COVID-19 affected education across the globe, the company has seen a shift to online medical education for doctors and students, said GIBLIB co-founder and CEO Brian Conyer who has remained in the U.S. “It’s been very sad to see many of our startup peers struggle during the pandemic,” Conyer told Crunchbase News via email. “We have been very fortunate to be on the benefiting side of the global black swan crisis. With most of our developers located in Seoul, we’ve had little disruption in terms of workflow and development. In fact, we are looking to expand our development team in Seoul and are actively hiring.” John Nahm , co-founder and managing partner of Los Angeles-based Strong Ventures , said South Korea’s local startup ecosystem is benefitting from its ability to bring COVID-19 under control. Strong Ventures, a seed fund with an office in Seoul, is an investor in GIBLIB. “The local startup ecosystem is thriving as a result of the accelerated digital adoption and transformation of society,” Nahm said via email. “You can preview in advance what a post-COVID world will look like and bring back those lessons to your local market.” Meanwhile, Tim Marzullo , co-founder and chief scientific officer at Backyard Brains , decided to stay in South Korea after finishing the K-Startup Grand Challenge in 2019. Given the country’s effective response to the pandemic, Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Backyard Brains was able to build a team and remain productive, he said via email. It was able to expand into elementary school education and make advances in its human physiology research tool prototype development. With Korea’s access to fresh sea life, Backyard Brains was also able to conduct research on the nervous systems of squids and octopi, something Marzullo said could only be conducted sporadically in the U.S. while visiting specialized marine research labs. “There was an initial unease in February, when the first cases outside of China appeared in Korea, but we decided to be patient and wait it out,” Marzullo said. “Fortunately we made the right decision.” Illustration: Dom Guzman","{'Backyard Brains': 'backyardbrains.com', 'HSBC': 'hsbc.com', 'Strong Ventures': 'strongvc.com', 'igniteXL Ventures': 'ignitexl.vc', 'GIBLIB': 'giblib.com'}"
"Credit Karma Goes Deeper Into Fintech With App Startup Haven Money. As every startup becomes a bank and every tech company does the same , one 12-year-old company that is already in the fintech space isn’t joining the growing crowd. Instead, San Francisco’s Credit Karma is finding innovation in a five-person team about two miles away from its current headquarters. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Credit Karma, which has amassed 100 million users to date, has acquired a five-person company to build out its savings app: Haven Money. The terms of the deal, including the price, were not disclosed. It’s part of the Credit Karma’s investment in autonomous finances for its customers, moving from understanding their customers money through credit scores and taxes to “playing an active role in it,” Jagjit Chawla, the vice president and general manager of Tax and Savings at Credit Karma, told me. “The industry of neobanks is trying to do a lot of different things,” he said. “I don’t intend for us to ever become a bank. But we still operate in a highly regulated financial industry.” This is the company’s seventh acquisition to date. Haven Money helps users manage their savings for investing and retirement using proprietary technology and algorithms. Per its website, Haven will no longer be available after December 15, 2019. After that. “any money still in Haven will be returned to its original source account,” the website says. Users were told to withdraw money before this date. While Credit Karma hasn’t yet made a decision on specific product plans, the company said it will leverage Haven Money’s technology and assets (once the deal closes, of course). “We have trust with customers to hold their money, the next step there would be is [to] help people managing someone’s personal finances,” Chawla said. “It’s not just a recommendation engine, it’s a place where you will go to think about your personal finances.” He said that of the 100 million people on the platform, half of the users come back on a quarterly basis. It makes sense, Credit Karma is assumedly trying to be on your mind not just during tax season, or when you’re worried about your credit score. Think week by week basis, instead. Credit Karma is one of the more old school companies in a blossoming crew of startups taking a crack at finance. During our call, Chawla said that historical perspective is one of the reasons he is optimistic about the company’s future. “Each [other fintech companies] has about 1 to 5 million users right now,” he said. “We’re in a different headspace. We are not looking to get to scale, we have already scaled.” Comparatively, Chime, which was founded in 2013, reached 5 million customers in September. It’s creating an FDIC-insured mobile bank with lower fees . It also recently raised $ 500 million in a Series E . Instead, Credit Karma has “the reverse problem” said Chawla, which is to keep building and compounding products to keep those millions of users happy. Each fintech company I’m seeing pop up is targeting a niche, whether it’s savings, micro investing, or something else. But just as we’ve seen with wellness apps, users aren’t going to want to download a million options for each aspect of their financial life Bigger companies, and eventually consolidation of smaller companies, will recognize how a holistic company that does everything from credit scores to savings products could be the slow and steady home screen mainstay.

"Meet PandemicTech: A 4-Year-Old Virtual Incubator Confronting Infectious Disease Threats. While the world is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, one Austin-based virtual incubator is amping up efforts to use technology to confront infectious disease threats. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Dr. Andrew Nerlinger and his wife, Dr. Lisa McDonald , launched PandemicTech in 2016. Its main goal has been to explore how the private sector and innovation community can take a different approach to preventing pandemics, instead of relying only on the government. Little did they know how timely and useful their efforts would be as the spread of COVID-19 has officially reached pandemic levels. Nerlinger is also a venture partner with Bill Wood Ventures, which was founded by prominent venture capitalist Bill Wood . Wood was a founding partner at the now defunct Austin Ventures and also founded Silverton Partners . McDonald is also director of health care at Austin Technology Incubator (ATI), the startup incubator of the The University of Texas at Austin . Wood got involved with PandemicTech in April 2018, and is now one of its primary funders along with the Houston-based Laura and John Arnold’s family office, Centaurus Advisors. “When Andrew told me about PandemicTech, it just looked really interesting as a way for me to apply some of my background in technology and entrepreneurship to help solve some really big global problems such as infectious diseases,” Wood told Crunchbase News. Since its inception, PandemicTech has issued grants and made investments in projects in Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Australia and Mexico. It recently launched “The PandemicTech Innovation Fellowship 2020 ” – a $100,000 innovation challenge focused on global health security. It’s also formed a partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Moredreck Chibi , regional adviser on innovation for WHO’s Regional Office of Africa , said he engaged PandemicTech and the Austin community to support the inaugural WHO Innovation Challenge that was launched in October 2018. PandemicTech offered the WHO “amazing support” on the evaluation of more than 2,400 applications, Chibi wrote via email. “We continue to work with PandemicTech on supporting the selected innovators to further develop their innovations for transition to scale,” he said. “This has been one of the most productive and fulfilling partnerships WHO AFRO had in complementing its effort towards scaling appropriate innovations fit for the African context.” Wood believes organizations that traditionally attack infectious disease threats are not really “built for innovation, and the use of technology.” “When you get plugged into global health, you realize the profound needs that are not being met,” Wood added. “You start to realize how dramatically unprepared we are. And now, when something like this [COVID-19] happens, the evidence is really clear that there has been an enormous lack of investment and innovation in this space.” McDonald agrees. The fundamental push behind PandemicTech was about preparing in advance for situations such as the Coraonavirus pandemic. “It’s very interesting to see that sort of reaction in the moment or retrospectively,” she told Crunchbase News. “And that supports the fundamental thesis behind what we’ve done.” From a humanitarian perspective, the WHO has launched its COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund , according to Nerlinger. But he said it will also be critical for the private sector to support local economies, particularly those left without a source of income, while still following public health guidelines. “The private sector can also drive the uptake of technologies like telemedicine that can both improve access to medical care and support the call for social distancing,” Nerlinger said. PandemicTech is also observing that many companies, even early-stage startups, are working on technologies that could be used to support our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We encourage these companies to seek partnerships that help adapt technologies to fighting COVID-19, particularly with promising technologies like telemedicine, and for investors to support these innovative efforts,” Nerlinger said. Beyond its goal of identifying promising applicants for its fellowship program, PandemicTech is looking for experienced mentors across sectors to join its advisory network. It’s also interested in partnering with investors or other funding organizations to support early-stage innovation in the fight against pandemics.

"Pandemic Survey Finds Founders Less Worried. NFX updated its VC and founder survey, which was last conducted early in the pandemic and released on April 2 . The updated survey , conducted at the end of May with early-stage founders (451 respondents) and VCs (141 respondents), shows that founders are a little less worried about the effects of the pandemic compared to how they felt at the end of March. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Overall, both founders and VCs have extended the time frame for the recovery, with the majority projecting recovery beyond April 2021. In the previous survey, VC drying up and sales were the top concerns for founders. Despite the projection of a longer recovery, the majority of founders (70 percent) reported that they see no change or growth in revenue, which is higher than expected going into the crisis. In the survey results, 60 percent of VCs report that early-stage valuations have dropped by 20 percent to 30 percent, and predict a further decline in valuations to an average of 40 percent in total. In Crunchbase’s data, we have not seen a decline in round size (which is a proxy for valuation) for the first five months of the year compared to previous years. That information is influenced by the fact that rounds added to Crunchbase in a timely manner tend to be larger. For now, reported rounds are holding up. As more data is added, however, average and median round sizes will come down. Leading tech companies have announced plans to allow team members to shift to remote work permanently, including Facebook , Square , Shopify and Twitter . This will be a major shift for Silicon Valley, doing more than any other trend to move tech away from the valley. Many startups also are changing their attitude about remote work. VC sentiment from the survey, however, is that remote work teams are less attractive for investment. This reaction is surprising as many companies report productivity has not been negatively impacted by remote work. Added to that, access to talent will expand, the cost of engineering talent will come down, and the major cost of office space will be reduced, which will allow startups to stretch investment dollars further. VC concern might have to do with acquisitions being less attractive if the acquirer values a team in one place. There are also concerns around the network effects of in-person relationships and spontaneous conversation, which can increase innovation. According to James Currier , founder of NFX, “The more distributed a team is, and for longer periods of time, the more a startup needs to reimagine the social and serendipitous attributes of work that office settings traditionally provided.” A high percentage of founders have not experienced a material impact to revenue growth. For 23.5 percent of responding founders, revenue has increased. Around 46 percent of founders see no change in revenue. For 30 percent of founders, revenue has decreased. Travel, energy, recruiting, construction and ad tech startups–in that order–are the most impacted, according to the survey. Despite revenue not being materially impacted for 70 percent of startups, hiring is nonetheless slowing down for many of them. A hiring freeze has been instituted at 40 percent of startups, and 32 percent are hiring more slowly. Only 10 percent of startups are hiring aggressively. For those that are hiring, 50 percent of founders report that salaries have come down. VC drying up was the top concern for founders from the earlier survey, ahead of sales and layoffs. There’s good news, however, we are not yet experiencing a significant contraction in venture funding. Funding in the U.S. is down slightly, by 14 percent for January-May 2020, compared to the same time period for 2019. 2020 funding dollars already exceed 2018’s amount by $700 million for the same time frame. It’s worth noting that due to data lags, 2020 funding will increase relative to prior years.

"SharesPost And Forge Global To Merge. Private securities marketplaces SharesPost and Forge Global will be merging, the companies announced Tuesday. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily The combined company will operate under the name Forge Global, with Forge Global CEO Kelly Rodriques continuing as the chief executive of the combined entity. SharesPost CEO Greg Brogger will step down from his role and join the company’s board of directors, according to a statement from the companies. “Together, we will provide our clients with even deeper insight into private company trends, including bid, offer and pricing data,” Brogger wrote in a blog post. “Though we believe all market participants will benefit from these enhancements, we think perhaps it is the private companies that ultimately will benefit the most. Providing efficient, company-controlled liquidity to shareholders and employees ensures that they will have continued access to growth capital and to the talent they need to build world beating companies.” SharesPost and Forge Global have facilitated more than 10,000 client transactions worth more than $6 billion in shares of more than 320 private companies, Brogger wrote. The companies give employees and investors access to private company information and liquidity. The merger positions the new combined company as a large player to compete in the private securities market. Nasdaq Private Market, which lets private companies do tender offers and share buybacks, and shareholders to sell private company stock to institutional investors, is another prominent player in the space. Carta is planning for a private share trading platform as well, according to the Financial Times . Forge Global agreed to $160 million in cash and stock for the deal, according to TechCrunch. Forge is backed by investors including Tim Draper and Peter Thiel, and SharesPost investors like Kinetic and LUN Partners Group , according to Crunchbase.

Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily The Austin-based company priced its shares at $24 apiece on Tuesday, raising more than $216 million. BigCommerce’s stock opened at $68 on Wednesday, with the price going as high as $91.80 around 12:35 p.m. ET. The company’s shares trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker BIGC. If a startup’s stock surging like crazy on its first day of trading sounds familiar, it’s because it’s been happening a lot lately.

"Andreessen Horowitz Raises $750M For Its Third Bio Fund. On Tuesday, Andreessen Horowitz (often abbreviated as “a16z”) announced it raised $750 million for it’s third fund, earmarked for biotechnology and health care investing. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Fund III is the largest in this series of funds. Andreessen Horowitz’s previous biotech and health care funds came in at $450 million for Bio Fund II (announced in December 2017) and $200 million for Bio Fund I (announced in November 2015).

"Accolade Is Latest To Join Health Service IPO Bandwagon. To launch a successful IPO in the current market environment, it seems to help to be a fast-growing health care services provider. Shares of One Medical , a provider of primary care clinics and telemedicine, closed up nearly 60 percent in first-day trading a month ago. Since then, it’s largely held on to those gains. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Progyny , a benefits management focusing on fertility, meanwhile, has seen its shares roughly double from its initial offer price back in October. While the broader markets have swooned, Progyny has held strong. Now, another well-funded health service company is betting investor enthusiasm for the space will trump market skittishness. Accolade , a service provider that serves as a kind of go-between for consumers, employers and health insurance companies, is seeking to raise up to $100 million in an IPO, according to a prospectus filed late Friday. Like most venture-backed companies on the IPO path, Accolade is posting both strong growth and persistent losses. Its most recent financials are for the ninth-month period ending Nov. 30, for which it reported revenue of $88 million, and a net loss of $49 million. For the corresponding period a year earlier, revenue was $60 million, with the same net loss of $49 million. (Accolade operates on a fiscal year ending in February, so results for its last full fiscal year are not yet available.) The company’s pitch to investors is that its platform will see continued large-scale adoption as health care plans and services become increasingly complicated for people to navigate. Its customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade to provide employees and their families “a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs,” per the IPO prospectus. Accolades core offerings includes a software platform backed by a support staff of health assistants and clinicians.

"Investors Serve Up $53M In Series C Funding To Web Dev Platform Netlify. Developer platform Netlify announced it has raised $53 million in a Series C funding led by EQT Ventures . Prior investors Andreessen Horowitz , Kleiner Perkins , and Preston-Werner Ventures 1 participated in the deal, which brings the San Francisco-based company’s total funding to $93 million. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Valuations and other key financial metrics were not publicly disclosed by the company. However, in its announcement, Netlify did say that it’s tripled its customer base (to 800,000 users) and revenue year over year. The company says that 8 percent of internet users visit a Netlify-powered site each month. In a public statement, Netlify’s co-founder and CEO Mathias Biilmann said “We started Netlify with the mission to empower developers and change the way the web is built. The growing number of developers signing onto Netlify daily and the latest investment in our business has validated that vision. With this funding we’re full-speed ahead delivering new features, investing in our enterprise-grade infrastructure and growing our team, to help more developers and businesses take advantage of the JAMstack.” What is the JAMstack? It’s a web development architecture co-developed by Biilmann. The acronym stands for JavaScript, APIs and prebuilt Markup. Dynamic functionality is handled by client-side JavaScript; server-side operations get abstracted into composable APIs which can be called over HTTPS via JavaScript; and sites are served as static HTML which can either be written natively or be generated from source files written in Markdown format using a static site generator. 2 The principal benefits the JAMstack offers to web developers is that sites can be served exclusively over a content delivery network (CDN), which improves scalability. Because a project’s entire codebase lives in a version control system like Git, and each deployment represents a snapshot of the entire site, developers are able to trace version histories and ensure consistency across an entire live site. Netlify builds software tools that help with different aspects of JAMstack development. Netlify Dev is a local application server developers can use for building and testing their websites prior to production deployment. Netlify Build is a Git workflow for web development. Edge is Netlify’s “application delivery network” that offers features some traditional CDNs don’t. “To enable more use cases at scale in 2020, we’re investing in new features catering to our enterprise customers, including more control and better collaboration for larger teams. We look forward to enabling the JAMstack at scale with the services they need as they look to migrate major parts of their web infrastructure to Netlify,” said co-founders Chris Bach and Matt Biilmann in a separate statement about the round. The company offers a set of pricing tiers for tinkerers and small teams, but with this new funding the company is intent to scale out its enterprise service offerings . These include more processing power on the build side, higher speed on the deployment side, and other client services like security auditing and premium support. “Netlify and the JAMstack are fundamentally changing how websites and web applications are built.

"Biotech IPOs Are On A Tear. While tech IPOs commonly generate a lot of buzz and big first-day gains, the same cannot be said for biotech. Typically, venture-backed biotech companies go public well before they’re generating revenue. For these companies, an IPO is less an exit and more a financing event, aimed at amassing capital for the costly work of R&D and clinical trials. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Given the lack of flashiness, most of us probably wouldn’t recognize the names of life sciences companies that tapped public markets this year. There are exceptions, such as last week’s blockbuster debut of CureVac , the German biotech deploying its messenger RNA technology in COVID-19 vaccine development. Overall, however, they’re an obscure bunch. Yet taken in aggregate, the numbers speak for themselves: Biotech IPOs are going gangbusters this year. So far in 2020, at least 37 venture-backed North American life sciences companies have carried out IPOs ( see list ), raising a total of $6.7 billion. By comparison, in all of 2019, the same cohort pulled in just $5 billion across 51 public offerings. Overall, this year is easily on track to post the highest biotech IPO numbers in five years. And not only are companies raising a lot of capital, they’re generating comparatively high market valuations as well. That’s illustrated in the chart below. A few deals this year stand out for size or performance: New Jersey-based Legend Biotech , a developer of cellular therapies backed by a host of large-cap pharmaceutical companies, raised $424 million in its June IPO, and was recently valued around $4 billion. Relay Therapeutics , a company applying its expertise in protein motion to the drug discovery process, just raised $400 million in a late July offering. Shares of the Massachusetts company are trading for roughly double the initial offering price. Pliant Therapeutics , a developer of therapies for the treatment of fibrosis, raised $144 million in its June IPO. Shares of the South San Francisco, California-based company have fallen from late June highs, but are still up more than 50 percent from the initial IPO price. We should note that it’s not just biotech IPOs that are up in 2020. Venture funding to life sciences companies is up as well, as we covered in July, which bodes well for the pipeline of startups eyeing future offerings. Additionally, the combination of a receptive market for new issues and a strong recent track record of post-IPO performance indicates we’ll probably see the high volume of biotech offerings continue. Another factor to consider: The search for COVID-19 therapies and vaccines has led to heightened public and investor interest in the inner workings of biotech. There’s good reason to presume that will only intensify should biotech innovation be the force that eventually puts the pandemic behind us.

"Lion Capital Takes Minority Stake In Real Estate Startup REX For $25M. REX , a licensed residential real estate brokerage using AI and big data, announced today it has received a $25 million investment from Lion Capital in exchange for a minority stake in the company. Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily Austin-based REX last November raised $40 million in what it described as a C1 round. That financing was an add-on from its $45 million Series C in January 2019. London-based Lion Capital’s new investment brings the startup’s total raised since its inception in late 2015 to $140 million, according to Crunchbase data. In a statement Lion Capital Partner Matthew Nordby said his firm believes the REX brand and service offerings are scalable to serve an expanded audience. “REX Homes was made for this exact moment where families need safe and secure options, and demand greater value when selling their asset or buying their next home,” he added. REX says the new financing follows a high-growth year for the company. In 2019, the startup said its listings grew about 160 percent. And its revenue surged 180 percent compared to the year prior. The COVID-19 pandemic is only fueling demand for its services, the company said. From January to April 2020, REX said it has helped consumers move three times more homes into escrow compared to the same period in 2019. For a quarter of the homes in escrow, the buyers only toured the home virtually, it added. And from January to March 2020, REX saw its virtual tours surge by 1,000 percent “as consumers looked for safe options to shop for homes.” Once a buyer has found the home it would like to purchase, REX says its “fully automated” back office can handle the entire transaction, including mortgage, escrow and insurance, without requiring any in-person meetings. REX currently has 220 full time employees,10 part time workers and approximately 245 gig workers (which it describes as a combination of mostly “Associate Agents” and a few IT-related contractors). That’s up from September 2019, when it had 185 full-time employees, three part time workers and about 220 gig workers. REX currently has 36 open roles, saying that it is focused on growing within targeted markets. As of April 2020, REX is operating in 17 states nationwide, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington DC. There are so many real estate tech startups these days that it can be difficult to differentiate them. Similar to Redfin, REX charges a lower commission (2 percent) than most traditional real estate brokerages, which typically charge 6 percent. Using data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, the startup claims to be able “to price homes more accurately than traditional brokerages.” It also pays its agents a salary, as opposed to working with them as contractors. If a buyer purchases an MLS home through REX Homes, the company returns 50 percent of the fee to the buyer. As part of a continued effort toward social good, REX Homes said it is also working with World Housing to fund the construction of a new home for every 50 homes sold on the REX platform. REX Homes is also currently contributing to a World Housing “Girls to Grannies” community in Cambodia by building a local school and 15 homes for needy families, with an additional 20 future homes slated to be built this year. In addition, CEO and co-founder Jack Ryan said he has dedicated his ownership in REX Homes to building homes and schools for children who have lost access to their parents.

"Postman Raises $150M, Reaching $2B Valuation. API development platform Postman raised $150 million in new funding, bringing its valuation to $2 billion.

The company’s other backers include CRV , which led its Series B last year, and Nexus Venture Partners , which led its Series A in 2016, according to Crunchbase. Asthana said he’s particularly excited about the Postman API Network, and the company will be investing in fully automatable solutions (such as security testing) and integrating with the full DevOps cycle. “We feel very strongly that we’re going to be driving more and more of the API revolution forward in the next decade,” Asthana said.
